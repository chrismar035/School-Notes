Setting up NACHOS in Ubuntu Linux

1) Download and Extract the nachos-java.tar.gz
2) Install sun-java6-jdk package. (sudo apt-get install sun-java6-sdk)
3) Add the nachos executable to your PATH, by adding the following lines to your ~/.profile file.

        if [ -d "$HOME/nachos/bin" ] ; then
          PATH="$HOME/nachos/bin:$PATH"
        fi

   Substitute your own path to the nachos bin/
4) NACHOS is now working.
5) To test, navigate in to the project1/ from within the nachos-java directory and run nachos.
  
Other Notes:
  The different parts of nachos are spread into sub-directories within the main nachos folder. There is also a copy
  of the necessary folders for project1 within a nachos/ folder in the project1/ folder. However, in project2/ there
  is no such nachos folder. Therefore, when you compile project2 it uses the files in the main nachos folder. It seems
  that these original main nachos files are not compiled correctly. I tried to 'make clean' and remake from the main
  nachos folder, but there 'is nothing to be done for all.' So, I copied the folders from project1/nachos to the main
  nachos folder and was able to successfully compile and run project2 (except for quitting it breaks with a
  nachos.machine.AssertionFailureError).

  To get rid of the Assertion Errors, I had to change the nachos.conf in the project2/ folder to be the same as the
  project1/nachos.conf. Mainly the last three lines:
    Kernel.shellProgram = halt.coff #sh.coff
    Kernel.processClassName = nachos.userprog.UserProcess
    Kernel.kernel = nachos.userprog.UserKernel
  This got project1 and 2 working for me.
